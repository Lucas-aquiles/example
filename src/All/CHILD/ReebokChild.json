Celebrating the arrival of spring, the brand re-released the 90s model in April 2014. The Reebok Kamikaze 2 Mid Big Kids &#39;Easter&#39; sneaker models itself after the adult version, reinterpreting it for kids&#39; wear. The shoe sports a perforated suede upper in shades of teal and a butter-yellow lining.","image":{"360":[],"original":"https://image.goat.com/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/018/459/230/original/M43143.png.png","small":"https://image.goat.com/750/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/018/459/230/original/M43143.png.png","thumbnail":"https://image.goat.com/375/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/018/459/230/original/M43143.png.png"},"links":{"stockX":"https://stockx.com/reebok-kamikaze-2-mid-easter-2014-gs","goat":"https://goat.com/sneakers/kamikaze-2-mid-big-kids-easter-m43143","flightClub":"https://flightclub.com/kamikaze-2-mid-big-kids-easter-m43143","stadiumGoods":"https://sale.stadiumgoods.com/reebok-kamikaze-ii-mid-girls-m43143"}},{"id":"97d23cfe-593e-41a5-830b-4617241ac015","sku":"V53880","brand":"Reebok","name":"Reebok Shaqnosis Candy Pink (GS)","colorway":"Candy Pink/Silver","gender":"child","silhouette":"Shaqnosis","releaseYear":"2013","releaseDate":"2013-11-08","retailPrice":90,"estimatedMarketValue":60,"story":"","image":{"360":[],"original":"https://image.goat.com/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/032/389/040/original/V53880.png.png","small":"https://image.goat.com/750/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/032/389/040/original/V53880.png.png","thumbnail":"https://image.goat.com/375/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/032/389/040/original/V53880.png.png"},"links":{"stockX":"https://stockx.com/reebok-shaqnosis-candy-pink-gs","goat":"https://goat.com/sneakers/shaqnosis-og-j-silver-pink-v53880","flightClub":"https://flightclub.com/shaqnosis-og-j-silver-pink-v53880","stadiumGoods":"https://sale.stadiumgoods.com/reebok-shaqnosis-og-v53880"}},{"id":"60bb46fe-4db5-4d85-92b2-166bfc916a2b","sku":"CN7334","brand":"Reebok","name":"Reebok CL Leather Ice White Royal (GS)","colorway":"White/Reebok Royal","gender":"child","silhouette":"Reebok Classic Leather Ice","releaseYear":"0","releaseDate":"","retailPrice":0,"estimatedMarketValue":0,"story":"","image":{"360":[],"original":"https://images.stockx.com/images/Reebok-CL-Leather-Ice-White-Royal-GS.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=500&h=500&fm=webp&auto=compress&trim=color&q=90&dpr=2&updated_at=1626899208","small":"https://images.stockx.com/images/Reebok-CL-Leather-Ice-White-Royal-GS.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=375&h=375&fm=webp&auto=compress&trim=color&q=90&dpr=2&updated_at=1626899208","thumbnail":"https://images.stockx.com/images/Reebok-CL-Leather-Ice-White-Royal-GS.jpg?fit=fill&bg=FFFFFF&w=200&h=200&fm=webp&auto=compress&trim=color&q=90&dpr=2&updated_at=1626899208"},"links":{"stockX":"https://stockx.com/reebok-cl-leather-ice-white-royal-gs","goat":"","flightClub":"","stadiumGoods":""}},{"id":"e08c03dc-cb61-4297-b330-a330f4bcfceb","sku":"50148","brand":"Reebok","name":"Reebok Classic Leather Black (GS)","colorway":"Black/Black","gender":"child","silhouette":"Reebok Classic","releaseYear":"0","releaseDate":"","retailPrice":70,"estimatedMarketValue":74,"story":"","image":{"360":[],"original":"https://image.goat.com/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/033/447/747/original/50148.png.png","small":"https://image.goat.com/750/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/033/447/747/original/50148.png.png","thumbnail":"https://image.goat.com/375/attachments/product_template_pictures/images/033/447/747/original/50148.png.png"},"links":{"stockX":"https://stockx.com/reebok-classic-leather-black-gs","goat":"https://goat.com/sneakers/classic-leather-j-black-50148","flightClub":"https://flightclub.com/classic-leather-j-black-50148","stadiumGoods":""}}]}
